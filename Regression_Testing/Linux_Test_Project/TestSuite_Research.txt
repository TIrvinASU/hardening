These test suites were recommended by ChatGPT-4 out of all test suites as the most relevant to test a DMA controller:
    
    Dma_thread_diotest- these tests reproduce a data corruption bug when direct I/O is used, and it occurs due to alignment issues with the buffer being read from to write to the dest file
    Dio- tests direct I/O
    Crypto - included because on our hardware board the CSU (Configuration Security Unit) utilizes the LPD DMA channels
    Ltp-aio-stress- Performs stress testing/benchmarking of AIO under various conditions, including for files opened w/ O_DIRECT
    Ltp-aiodio.part1 - Ltp-aiodio.part4 - each test functionality related to file operations
    Smoketest - performs the following general tests (this is /runtest/smoketest contents):
        access01 access01
        chdir01 chdir01
        fork01 fork01
        time01 time01
        wait02 wait02
        write01 write01
        symlink01 symlink01
        stat04 symlink01 -T stat04
        utime01A symlink01 -T utime01
        rename01A symlink01 -T rename01
        splice02 splice02 -s 20
        df01_sh df01.sh
        shell_test01 echo "SUCCESS" | shell_pipe01.sh
        ping602 ping02.sh -6
        macsec02 macsec02.sh

After an investigation into the functionality of each test suite, I did not have confidence in these test suites for various reasons:

    Perform direct I/O, which likely uses a DMA but requires the filesystem being used to support opening a file with O_DIRECT. The filesystem used on our board did not support this, and while an alternative filesystem could be used, it wasn't specified what the final filesystem was that would be used in the product. This ambiguity, in addition to only testing a DMA by proxy, and thus not giving direct insight into the DMA's functionality, did not give enough confidence to utilize these test suites.
        Dma_thread_diotest
        Dio
        Ltp-aiodio.part1 - Ltp-aiodio.part4

    Only test the DMA by proxy and don't give direct insight into DMA functionality, and thus aren't used.
        Crypto
        Ltp-aio-stress

    Performs only general tests
        Smoketest
